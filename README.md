## 🎨 Design Philosophy

VibeSRM abandons the boring, generic "admin panel" look for a **top-tier, app-like experience**.
- **Dark Mode First**: Deep charcoal backgrounds (`#050507`) reduce eye strain.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle frosting and borders for depth.
- **Micro-interactions**: Every button and card feels alive.
